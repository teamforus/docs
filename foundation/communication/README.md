## Vision

An organisation with the image that best represents our values.

## Mission

To inform and inspire.

## Objectives

### Objective 1

Establish a brand identity that represents our values. We consider these values to be future proof.

### Objective 2

Survive the hype. We are building decentralized applications and need decentralized technologies to be able to do so. These decentralized technologies are innovative and not in their final form. This leads to a situation in which we are trying to derive value from chaos. We are trying to apply these new technologies where possible while keeping our values in mind. This practice can however lead to our association with chaos and can therefore be seen as dangerous. We need to make sure we are clear in our communication so that our tangible succes and our vision will have the upper hand against these associations.
