### 1. A start is always better than nothing

Once you have identified a problem it helps to immediately think of a quick fix. This will stop the bleeding for the moment and gives room to find a better solution. It also functions as a pointer for others so they can help you iterate.

### 2. Boring solutions (taken from gitlab)

Use the simplest and most boring solution for a problem, and remember that “boring” should not be conflated with “bad.“ The speed of innovation for our organization and product is constrained by the total complexity we have added so far, so every little reduction in complexity helps. Don’t pick an interesting technology just to make your work more fun; using established, popular tech will ensure a stabler and more familiar experience for you and other contributors.
This strategy can be 

### 3. Dish yourself the right amount and finish your plate

You need to eat the right amount to survive but do not eat to much cause you stomach will hurt.

This strategy can be 

### 1. Start small, make it tangible and then scale.

Concepts are great but a project only has value once it has been put to the test of reality and the results of the project positively impact all of the stakeholders. In order to determine the impact; a full cycle of the processes of conceptualization, development, implementation, and feedback need to be completed. A small project in which all the stakeholders have been taken into consideration and the of which the impact has been analysed will provide valuable insights will keeping risks to a relative minimum.  After this we will be ready to scale up.

We are applying this strategy now in Zuidhorn with Kindpakket. We are trying

### 2. Considering all the aspects

A proof of concept needs to take all aspects into consideration. Software needs to be implemented in order to provide value. An organisation needs a sustainable business model in order to provide value. More than only software.

We will strive towards obtaining the perfect scope and 

### 4. The power of momentum

We will strive towards obtaining the perfect scope and 

### 2. Road of the least resistance

By working with partners that are willing to move fast we will be able to gain traction. Large cooperations or big government sound like cool partners but you pay a price.

### 2. The continuous feedback loop

We need to know how to improve. Each of the stakeholders needs a voice.

### 3. Not for profit

Profit is not our main goal. It is the means to an end. We are striving towards self-sovereignty and therefor these systems are not te be taxed.

### 4. Give and take credit where credit is due

This applies to the internal organisation as well as our press strategy. 

### 5. Opensource

### 6. Only scale when scaling is needed.

### 7. Continues reconnaissance of innovation

Online, offline, decentralized, projects, Business models, collaboration models

### 8. Privacy by design

Data minimization. Only obtain information needed for the functioning of the system. Control of data back to to the end user.

### 9. Quick replies, low barrier to communicate with us, open about goals and progress, risks and successes

This requires some more investment

### 10. Do not make it bigger than it is.
