## Self-managing teams

The aim is to go from a traditional structure towards a progressive organisational structure. We start with defining individual responsibilities and associated tasks (traditional) and work together to allocate them to team level (progressive). The end result are teams that excels in self-management.

Our organisation is operating in a fast paced environment and in order to succeed; we need to be flexible and adaptive. Each one of us needs to keep looking for improvements wherever possible and incorporate the processes that led successful resolution of these problem into policies that will help others to do the same.

As a start we have made a general division of the main responsibilities. Most of these teams consist of single members who will be the founding fathers and mothers of a team to be. In essence they will be solely responsible the teams achievements. For the teams that have already grown past this point and consist of multiple members it is now time to find out their preferred collaboration methods and ways to achieve common goals.

Self managing teams require a common vision, strategy and action plan. The visions of each of the teams need to be inline with other teams and therefore the organisation as a whole. You here you can read more about our organisational values, vision, mission, objectives and strategy.
