# me

### why build me?
The average user on the internet has 90 accounts on the internet. That is because every application (roughly) has an application layer (what you see) an identity layer (your username/password) and a data layer.

All of this is owned and operated by the owner of the platform you are using.

The landscape of applications is fragmented, and therefore we, as users have to maintain all our accounts on the internet.

We currently see apllications appear that are building very big identity layers (e.g. social networks) that allow us to log in on other aplications using their identity. This may provide user experience benifits but increases the amount of trust we have to place in the centralized parties.

By using new technologies it might be possible to change this whole model:

### How to build me
The me app will use [ethereum](), [ipfs]() etc. etc. As our [roadmap]() specifies, initially many parts of the me app will be working with centralized systems, build and maintained mainly by [foundation forus](). 

As much as possible, we are trying to implement open standards that are embraced by the community. e.g. [ERC20](standards/ERC20.md) for tokens, [ERC721](standards/ERC721.md) for assets, [ERC725](standards/ERC725.md) for identity, [ERC735](standards/ERC735.md) for claims. 

### What me will do

The me app will support three main groups of functionality: a wallet for the things you own, your personal records and a way to identify and interact with third parties (applications, people or organisations)
