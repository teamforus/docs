## Research-and-development

Our vision is to develop decentralized applications for the public domain. We started a foundation to give this vision more concrete goals. A goal for us was doing a feasibility study towards our concept of a decentralized platform. This feasibility study was written down in context of a Small Business Inovation Research (SBIR). A SBIR is innovation in commission set out by the Ministery of Economic Affairs. This process taught us alot, currently our R&D phase is over and we are working on building a prototype of our platform using four decentralized roles: sponsor, provider, requester and validator. There is still alot to research though. ;)

Research and development towards complete decentralization is alot of work. We invite anybody into this proces and share their results.

## Goal of our research and development repostitory

The goal of the [research-and-development repository](https://github.com/teamforus/research-and-development) is to learn and share knowledge around decentralized development. We are researching, creating and improving the building blocks of [Platform Forus](https://foundation.forus.io/en/platform/) and any other fully decentralized platform/application.

## Getting started

Every project folder contains a readme describing its contents. The [wiki](https://github.com/teamforus/research-and-development/wiki) contains general information, [issues](https://github.com/teamforus/research-and-development/issues) are for making and discussing proposals, [branches](https://github.com/teamforus/research-and-development/branches/all) show what is currently being worked on. 

## Workflow

Topic suggestions and discussions take place over at the [issues](https://github.com/teamforus/research-and-development/issues).

When work starts the assignee creates a **feature branch** with a **project folder** and a **readme** where the work is  performed and documented ([example-project](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/tree/poc0-example/poc0-example)). The assignee then opens a [pull-request](https://github.com/teamforus/research-and-development/pulls) where discussions can continue and where the issue number will also be assigned before merging into develop.
