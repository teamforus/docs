If you're reading this page, you have probably been assigned as a maintainer to a repository or project board, and would like to know what it means to be a maintainer. Github has a nice page about it here: https://opensource.guide/best-practices/

For us specifically a maintainer:

* Periodically checks all issues in the repository and asks for status updates if there has not been any activity for about two weeks. If the issue seems to not be relevant any longer, the maintainer can close the issue.
* Chooses if a wiki, issue section and/or project board are necessary for the repository.
* Makes sure readme files and documentation are up to date.
