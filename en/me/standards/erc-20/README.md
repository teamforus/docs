## Standard: ERC20
Ethereum Request for Comment 20, or ERC20 is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal introduced by Fabian Vogelsteller and Vitalik Buterin in late 2015.

One critical innovation in the creation of Ethereum-based tokens is this standard. Similar to how the HTTP protocol defined the internet, ERC20 is a protocol that defines a set of commands that a token should implement. 

A simple summary of the standard can be found here:
