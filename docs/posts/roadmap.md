# Product development roadmap

## Forus.io: a platform for the conditional exchange of value

#### Hackathon demo

The initial concept for forus.io was presented at the Dutch Blockchain hackathon, februari of 2017. It showed a vision for a decentralized platform...

#### v0.0.1: Proof of concept.

After winning the hackathon the team decided to test if the version would work in a real world scenario. On nov 1 Kindpakket was launched in the municipality of Zuidhorn in the Netherlands. [...]

* closed source
* single ethereum node
* mostly traditional
* etc. etc.

#### v0.1.0: Traditional system with decentralized component.

On x we started open source development on the first version of forus.io. With lessons learned from our proof of concept, this version is meant to be more scalable, modulair, upgradable and extensible. While the main focus of this platform is to provide real value to end users, we are also using it to work towards our vision of full decentralisation.

#### v1.0: Decentralized platform.

The real vision of forus.io is to be a fully decentralized system where users can create funds, set criteria for who is eligible to recieve the funds, and for those people to apply for funds without interference of any centralized party (including Foundation Forus). Reaching this vision will take time and resources, but we are set on achieving it.


## Me: an app for managing identity, assets and records  
  
#### v0.0.1: Hackathon demo (common ground)
During a feasibiltiy study we worked on for the Dutch RVO we created a vision for a self sovereign identity solution that would be user friendly, based on standards, and fitting the needs of forus.io and other applications. bla bla.

During a field lab for the assosiation of dutch... we created the first demo of how this system would work.

#### v0.1.0: Traditional app / proof of concept

We are currently working on the first real-world application of the me app. It is to be launched together with forus.io v0.1.0. Initialy the feature set will be focussed on providing the right funcionality to operate together with forus.io. We will use it to learn how the application behaves in the real world, and use these lessons for future development.

The main focus is to learn how to provide maximum value to real-world users.

#### v1.0: Self sovereign identity

The full vision of the me app is to be a fully self-sovereign identity. Meaning that you own your data and keys, and there is no centralized party involved. Just like with forus.io this is a vision that required time and dedication
