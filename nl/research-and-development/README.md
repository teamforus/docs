## Goal

The goal of this repository is to learn and share knowledge around decentralized development. We are researching, creating and improving the building blocks of [Platform Forus](https://foundation.forus.io/en/platform/) and any other fully decentralized platform/application.

## Getting started

Every project folder contains a readme describing its contents. The [wiki](https://github.com/teamforus/research-and-development/wiki) contains general information, [issues](https://github.com/teamforus/research-and-development/issues) are for making and discussing proposals, [branches](https://github.com/teamforus/research-and-development/branches/all) show what is currently being worked on. 

## Workflow

Topic suggestions and discussions take place over at the [issues](https://github.com/teamforus/research-and-development/issues).

When work starts the assignee creates a **feature branch** with a **project folder** and a **readme** where the work is  performed and documented ([example-project](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/tree/poc0-example/poc0-example)). The assignee then opens a [pull-request](https://github.com/teamforus/research-and-development/pulls) where discussions can continue and where the issue number will also be assigned before merging into develop.
