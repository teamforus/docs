## Standard: ERC721

Ethereum Request for Comments 721, or ERC721, is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal introduced by Dieter Shirley in late 2017. Itâ€™s a standard that would allow smart contracts to operate as tradeable tokens similar to ERC20. ERC721 tokens are unique in that the tokens are non-fungible.

A great example of unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain are [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/). This game made serveral headlines because of its extremely unique idea and the dent its made on the Ethereum network. CryptoKitties is a game in which players can buy, sell, trade, and breed  unique digital cats. This uniqueness makes the CryptoKitties extremely collectible, as someone could take interest in the characteristics of several kittens and wish to own many of them.
