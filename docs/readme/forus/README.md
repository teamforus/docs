# forus


### Why we are making forus

It is currently a very cumbersome process to make resources end up with a target audience. For the sponsor it is hard to find the target audience and spread awareness about the availability of the funds. When recieving a request, it is hard to validate that the requesting party is eligible to recieve the grant. The flow of payments is a very administrative process. For the requesting party this situation is not any better. They usually don't know what they are eligle for, and the application process is usually very labor intensive. Providers also have to do a lot of administration, often working with vouchers or invoice requests.

By applying modern-day technology and human-centered experience design, it is possible to make great steps in improving this process. By giving the user an identity where they hold their signed records.


### What is forus?

Forus is a platform for the conditional exchange of value. The platform knows four generic actors:

A **sponsor** who makes resources available under certain criteria. 
A **requester** who applies for the resources. A **validator** that signs criteria of requesters. A **provider** who delivers the product or service, and recieves payment from the sponsor.

### The main interaction
**A user** has an [identity](https://github.com/teamforus/concept-identity) that holds properties and assets.  
**An offer** is a product/service made to be available under certain criteria.  

**If** the *properties* of the user equal the *criteria* of the offer **then** perform the transaction.

### Example case of an implementation of Forus
An example of an implementation in which all of these roles would interact, could look like an e-commerce platform for governmental services.

A citizen (requester) could apply for special health-related assistance pledged by a municipality (sponsor), if he/she is entitled to it according to certain criteria arising from predetermined policy.

To check if the citizen meets these criteria a doctor (validator) can be chosen by the municipality to validate the condition of the citizen.

The actual assistance is provided in hospital (provider).
