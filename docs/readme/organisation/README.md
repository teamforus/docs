# organsation

## about the organisation
* "Forus" comes from "for us" and is an open organisation, everybody is welcome to get involved and "join us".

## way of working
* we want to provide value right now, and also have a vision of "decentralising ourselves away" as much as possible.
* our vision about decentralisation, its current status and our roadmap, how we are planning to implement in Zuidhorn, etc.

## collaboration
* at some point we might do open zoom meetings etc, here we can have the schedules etc.
