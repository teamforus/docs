Taken into consideration organisational strategic policy number 2: "[Boring Solutions](https://github.com/teamforus/foundation-direction/wiki/Strategy#2-boring-solutions-taken-from-gitlab)" the underlying blockquote has some keypoints on risk management. We can use these guidelines during our meetings when discussing risks.

> **The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) identifies the following principles of risk management**
>
> Risk management should:
>
> * create value â€“ resources expended to mitigate risk should be less than the consequence of inaction
> * be an integral part of organizational processes
> * be part of decision making process
> * explicitly address uncertainty and assumptions
> * be a systematic and structured process
> * be based on the best available information
> * be tailorable
> * take human factors into account
> * be transparent and inclusive
> * be dynamic, iterative and responsive to change
> * be capable of continual improvement and enhancement
> * be continually or periodically re-assessed

The ISO document can be found here: http://www.snti.ru/cd/ISO310002018.pdf

In terms of addressing and assessing risks we can consider them as potential subjects of "beleidsstukken" which anyone can submit for discussion during the weekly meeting.
